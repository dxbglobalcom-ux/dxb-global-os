# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-05)

**Core value:** Anti-baby-sitting — the CEO states intent once; the company executes end-to-end autonomously, with hard approval gates only where actions face outward.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — security-baseline-credential-remediation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (security-baseline-credential-remediation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-05 — Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Approved P0–P7 shape subdivided into 11 phases — P2 split into State Layer (3) / Safety Rails (4) / Kernel Core Loop (5); P5 split into Dashboard (8) / JARVIS Voice (9)
- [Roadmap]: Full schema (incl. memory_index + CRM tables) lands in Phase 3 — schema-first, "full architecture first" directive; UIs arrive later as pure projections
- [Roadmap]: COST-04 (cost dashboard view) mapped to Phase 8 — cost *enforcement* is Phase 4; the CEO-visible per-dept/model/mode view needs the cockpit
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is a hard exit gate — old keys verifiably dead (401 evidence), 2FA, sanitized .odt, clean secret scan; nothing else starts before it passes
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: gitleaks v8.24.3 sha256-verified install; canary matched generic-api-key rule; gitleaks-action @v2 tag with SHA-pin TODO at remote go-live
- [Phase 01-02]: A8 deny spot-check PASSED - agent file-read of .env refused at tool layer; real .env goes to repo root in Wave 2, no out-of-workspace relocation needed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Credential rotation is CEO-owned manual work (checklist duty) — build work cannot start until old keys verifiably fail
- [Phase 6]: Memory-store composition (Obsidian + Graphify + open-notebook + pgvector behind one router) rated LOW confidence — plan a routing-quality validation spike
- [Phase 7]: MCP gateway per-department scoping is the least-commoditized piece — study pass (docker/mcp-gateway, ContextForge, Lasso) required at phase planning
- [Phase 7]: 8GB VPS RAM budget is tight (Supabase + Speaches + Hermes + open-notebook) — fallback plan documented in research STACK.md
- [Phase 11]: Stripe/DocuSign restricted-key scoping + WooCommerce staging patterns need verification at planning time (touches real money)
